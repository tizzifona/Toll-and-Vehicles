# Toll and Vehicles

## ✅Overview

This program simulates a toll system. The toll stations have a name, the city where they are located, and a numerical value representing the total toll collected.

Vehicles arriving at a toll station have a license plate. The toll varies depending on the type of vehicle:

- Car: The toll fee is $100.
- Motorcycle: The toll fee is $50.
- Truck: The toll fee depends on the number of axles; the charge is $50 per axle.
- The toll station must calculate the toll for each vehicle that arrives and track the total toll collected. At the end, the system should display a list of all vehicles that passed through the toll, along with the accumulated total toll.

## ✅Features
